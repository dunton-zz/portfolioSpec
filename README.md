# Portfolio Project

## Background

This is a personal portfolio page based off the design mockup we were assigned for this progect. The mockup can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf). Since I did the Full Stack Developer Nanodegree, my projects listed at the bottom are different than on the mockup. 

## Files

When the file is unzipped there should be two folders and 3 files. The content is as follows.
* **README.md**
* **portfolio**.**html**
* **images** folder
    * **cda.jpg**
    * **coffee.jpg**
    * **rd.jgp**
    * **theatre.jpg**
    * **hangman.jpg**
* **css** folder
    * **main.css**

## Running the Program

Use your browser of choice to open **portfolio.html**. That is it!
